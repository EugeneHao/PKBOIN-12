```

The main function for running the simulation is called `fun_TITE_PK_fixsimu`. Below are some important arguments for this function: 

+ `design`: specifies the model-assisted design used for the simulation. The options are PKBOIN-12 and TITE-PKBOIN-12
+ `current`: initial dose level.
+ `doselimit`: determines the maximum number of patients assigned to a single dose before terminating the trial. If this limit is not reached, the trial continues until the total sample size reaches csize * cN. By default, doselimit = Inf.
+ `susp`: cutoff point for suspension. For TITE-BOIN12 and TITE-PKBOIN-12, `susp = 0.5`, meaning accrual is suspended to wait for more data if the ascertained toxicity or efficacy outcomes of current dose do not reach 50%. 
+ `tox_dist`: distribution of time to toxicity outcome.
+ `eff_dist`: distribution of time to efficacy outcome.
+ `use_susp`: if true, the suspension rule is applied.
+ `accrual_random`: if true, the accrual time for enrolling the next patient is randomly generated from $U(0, 2 * accrual)$.
+ `considerPK`: if true, consider the PK outcome. This is set to TRUE for PKBOIN-12 and TITE-PKBOIN-12

                csize = csize, cN = cN, design = "PKBOIN-12",
                current = 1, doselimit = Inf,
                u11 = u11, u00 = u00, cutoff_tox = cutoff_tox, cutoff_eff = cutoff_eff,
                repsize = repsize, n_cores = n_cores,
                accrual = accrual, susp = 1, tox_win = tox_win, eff_win = eff_win,

# TITE-PKBOIN-12 
TITE_PKBOIN12_result <- 
  fun_TITE_PK_fixsimu(dN = dN,
                rV = rV, pV = pV, qV = qV, 
                pT = pT, qE = qE, pqcorr = 0, psi0PK = psi0PK, CV = CV, g_P = g_P, 
                csize = csize, cN = cN, design = "TITE-PKBOIN-12",
                current = 1, doselimit = Inf,

```

The output of running `fun_TITE_PK_fixsimu` is a `data.frame` with `repsize` rows. The variables included in the output are as follows:

+ `n`: maximum sample size
+ `design`: the specified design method  
+ `trueOBD`: the true OBD based on the true probability values given $u_{11}$ and $u_{00}$. A value of -1 indicates that none of the dose levels have a true OBD
+ `OBD`: the selected OBD, where `OBD = 99` means early termination without selecting any dose as the OBD
+ `rN`: the number of remaining dose levels for OBD selection 
+ `select_OBD`: indicates whether the true OBD was correctly identified
+ `num_at_OBD`: the number of patients assigned to the OBD
+ `risk_allocate`: a value of 1 indicates that the trial assigned less than 20% of patients to the true OBD
+ `num_overdose_OBD`: the number of patients assigned to the toxic doses if the true OBD exists
+ `num_overdose_nOBD`: the number of patients assigned to the toxic doses if the true OBD does not exist
+ `duration`: the trial duration in days
+ `1`, ..., `6`: the number of patients assigned to dose level 1 through 6 


Next we combine the above results of all designs and summarize the outputs: 

```r
result <- rbind(PKBOIN12_result, TITE_PKBOIN12_result)

result_summary <- 
   result %>% 
   group_by(design) %>% 
   summarise(OBD99 = mean(OBD == 99, na.rm = T) * 100,
             OBDother = mean(OBD == trueOBD, na.rm = T) * 100,
             p1 = mean(OBD == 1, na.rm = T) * 100, p2 = mean(OBD == 2, na.rm = T) * 100,
             p3 = mean(OBD == 3, na.rm = T) * 100, p4 = mean(OBD == 4, na.rm = T) * 100, 
             p5 = mean(OBD == 5, na.rm = T) * 100, p6 = mean(OBD == 6, na.rm = T) * 100, 
             n1 = mean(`1`, na.rm = T), n2 = mean(`2`, na.rm = T), 
             n3 = mean(`3`, na.rm = T), n4 = mean(`4`, na.rm = T), 
             n5 = mean(`5`, na.rm = T), n6 = mean(`6`, na.rm = T),
             dur = mean(duration, na.rm = T)/30) %>% 
   mutate(p_OBD = ifelse(rep(trueOBD, 2) <= 0, OBD99, OBDother), 
          p_rej = 100 - p1 - p2 - p3 - p4 - p5 - p6) %>% 
   select(-OBD99, -OBDother) %>% "["(,c(1, 15, 2:7, 16, 8:14))
